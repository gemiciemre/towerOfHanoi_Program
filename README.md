Tower of Hanoi is a very famous puzzle that involves disks numbered from 1 to a number n and three poles. The size of the disk is directly proportional to the number on it and the three poles are known as source pole, auxiliary pole and destination pole. The disks are first on the source pole in a descending order from bottom to top i.e. the disk numbered 1(smallest disk) is on the top of the stack. The objective is to move the disks from the source pole to the destination pole according to the following rules-

1) You can move any one disk at a time.
2) You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
